# Airbnb Seattle Data - Exploratory Data Analysis
The main idea of the analysis was to find the best time to visit Seattle and the possibility of accommodation in good areas of the city.
I decided to answer how this can be done.
The analysis contains several graphs that will help me do this.
For correct operation, you need the following files.
